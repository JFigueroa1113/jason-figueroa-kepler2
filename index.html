            <h2>About</h2>
            <p><strong>Hi! I'm Jason Figueroa.</strong></p>
              <p>I was a graphic design major in collegeâ€”until burnout hit... <strong>HARD</strong>. That pushed me to pause, reflect, and explore other avenues of education. I decided to take an extended break from school to travel, experience new things, and figure out what paths inspire me.</p>
              <p>Along the way, I've been immersing myself in languages like Spanish, Norwegian, and Japanese, while also picking up various trades and skills. I've spent time with family in Zacatecas, relaxed in Mexico City, and even made a big move from Georgia to Oregon... before circling back to Georgia for to start again.</p>
              <p>Now, I'm looking ahead. I'm exploring opportunities in Arizona or Colorado, depending on where the road leads. While I may return to finish my graphic design degree one day, I've recently found myself drawn to the world of coding and development. That's the path I'm currently pursuing to see where it takes me and how I can blend creativity with technology.</p>

                  In high school, I completed an introductory web developement class where I learned the fundamentals of website structure and design using HTML and CSS. 
                  I am currently enrolled in an intensive 15 week coding course focused on developing proficiency in JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS, with hands-on experience in building interactive web projects, practicing responsive design, and learning core programming concepts like DOM manipulation and API integration. 
                  In addition, I have basic experience in modding PC games during college, which helped me gain foundational skills in scripting, debugging, and working with game assets and configuration files. 
                  Through these independent projects, I developed a deeper understanding of programming logic and enjoyed participating in modding communities to exchange ideas and best practices.
